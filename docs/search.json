    "text": "1.1 Basic Probability Definitions and Calculations\nWhen we are uncertain about an outcome’s occurrence (e.g., whether a coin will come up heads or tails, the number of dots observed on the roll of a die, whether or not the bus will be late), we typically quantify this uncertainty with a probability. Probability is the foundation upon which all of statistics is built, and it a provides a framework for modeling populations, experiments, and almost anything that could be considered a random phenomenon.\nA sample space, denoted by \\(\\cal{S}\\), is comprised of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon.\nAn event is a collection of possible outcomes. Each event \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(\\cal{S}\\).\nWe want to formalize the idea of the “chance” that event \\(A\\) occurs. We will do this by defining the probability of each \\(A\\), which we denote \\(P(A)\\).\nProbabilities are calculated by defining functions on sets, and should be defined for all possible events. One thing that must be true: \\[\n0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1\n\\]\nMore formally, a probability function is defined as follows.\nGiven a sample space \\(\\cal{S}\\), a probability function is a function P(\\(\\cdot\\)) that satisfies\nRequirements (1) - (3) are called the\nAny function P(\\(\\cdot\\)) that satisfies the Axioms of Probability is called a probability function.\nHere’s a (hopefully) obvious theorem:\nTheorem: Let \\((\\cal{S}, \\hbox{P})\\) be a sample space and associated probability function, respectively. For any event \\(A \\in \\cal{S}\\)\nAnd another, maybe less obvious.\nTheorem: Let \\((\\cal{S}, \\hbox{P})\\) be a sample space and associated probability function, respectively. For any events \\(A\\), \\(B \\in \\cal{S}\\)\nWe’ll use these theorems often when calculating probabilities. However, we first need to figure out how to assign probabilities to specific events. In some cases, we can do that by figuring out how many possible events there are in a sample space.\nIn a finite sample space, when all outcomes are equally likely, the number of possible outcomes can be used to make probability assignments.\nExample: Toss a fair, six-sided die\nOther Examples:\nOften, it is difficult to list all of the outcomes in a sample space, even when it is finite. In such circumstances, other methods must be employed to count the number of outcomes in a sample space.\nExample:\nWhy is the number of possible outcomes important? Because when each outcome is equally likely, we use the number of possible outcomes to find the probabilities of various events. The problem is that Fundamental Theorem of Counting doesn’t always (obviously) work. To determine the number of ways a task can be completed, we often need to consider whether sampling occurs with or without replacement and whether sampling is ordered or unordered. We’re not going to go into a ton of detail here. Some of these combinatorics scenarios really aren’t helpful to us, and most situations don’t involve outcomes that are all equally likely.\nSome quick and dirty examples:\nOrdered, with replacement: Number of different 6-character license plates if the first 3 characters must be letters and the final 3 characters must be numbers.\nIn general:\nOrdered, without replacement: Number of different lead-off (i.e., first three batters) batting orders for a baseball team consisting of 9 players.\nIn general:\nUnordered, without replacement: A student is to answer 7 out of 10 questions on an exam. How many choice are there?\nIn general:\nUnordered, with replacement: This one is not terribly intuitive, and not terribly useful anyway. I couldn’t think of a realistic scenario. In case you care:\nExample: Suppose Alabama (which does not have a state lottery) is considering four possible lottery drawing configurations:\nBottom line: the total number of ways to pick \\(r\\) items from a total of \\(n\\) distinguishable items depends on whether or not order matters, as well as whether sampling is done with or without replacement.\nUnordered, without replacement will turn out to be the most case we use most often (and we’ll use that one A LOT).",
